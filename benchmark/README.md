# Benchmarking scripts

This folder contains a set of scripts to run comparative benchmarks of DASPack on example data. 

Data examples can be downloaded from [link].

`bench_helper.py` and `compression_methods.py` contain helper functions that are used from the benchmarking script, `run_example.py`. 

To run benchmarks, modify `run_example.py` as convenient and run 

```
python run_example.py
```
